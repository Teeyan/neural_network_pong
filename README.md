# neural_network_pong
4 Layer Neural Network Pong playing agent trained with ReLU non-linearity

Necessary Libraries :

* pygame
* numpy 

Relevant Files for playing :

* weights_.txt files
* bias_.txt files

* behavioral_cloning.py
* pong.py - for human vs agent gameplay
* cpu_pong.py - for agent vs wall gameplay
* environment.py - for agent vs wall gameplay

Running under python3. Just running respective scripts pong.py and cpu_pong.py will launch the game.

The repo is a bit cluttered ATM due to playing around with training parameters / debugging. Will clean up in the future.
